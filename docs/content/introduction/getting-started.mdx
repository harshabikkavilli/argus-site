## Overview

Argus is a local-first observability tool designed specifically for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It acts as a transparent proxy between your LLM client (like Claude Desktop) and your MCP servers, capturing every tool execution, error, and latency metric.

<Callout type='info' title='Prerequisites'>
	Before installing Argus, ensure you have `Node.js >= 18.0.0` and `npm`
	installed on your machine.
</Callout>

## Installation

Argus is distributed as a global npm package. You can install it with a single command:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @argusai/cli

# Verify installation
argus --version
```

## Quick Start

Getting started with Argus takes just two commands:

### 1. Start the Dashboard

Open a terminal and start the Argus dashboard:

```bash
argus dashboard --open
```

This will start the monitoring dashboard on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically open it in your browser.

### 2. Wrap Your MCP Server

In another terminal, wrap any MCP server to start recording:

```bash
argus wrap --api http://localhost:3000 -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp
```

That's it! Make tool calls from your LLM client and watch them appear in real-time.

## Dashboard Preview

The Argus dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all your MCP tool calls:

- **Timeline View**: See every tool call with timestamps and duration
- **Request/Response Inspector**: Examine full payloads with syntax highlighting
- **Error Tracking**: Quickly identify and debug failed calls
- **Replay Functionality**: Re-run any tool call without involving the LLM

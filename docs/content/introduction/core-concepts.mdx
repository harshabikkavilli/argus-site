## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized protocol that allows LLM applications to interact with external tools and services. It defines how tools are discovered, invoked, and how results are returned.

## How Argus Works

Argus operates as a **transparent proxy** between your MCP client and server:

1. Your LLM client connects to Argus instead of the MCP server directly
2. Argus forwards requests to the actual MCP server
3. All requests and responses are captured and stored
4. The dashboard displays calls in real-time

## Key Components

### Proxy (Wrap)

The `argus wrap` command creates a proxy wrapper around any MCP server. This allows Argus to intercept and record all communication.

### Dashboard

The web-based dashboard provides real-time monitoring, filtering, and debugging capabilities.

### Runs

Tool calls are automatically grouped into **runs** based on connection sessions and idle timeouts. This helps organize debugging sessions.

### Replay

Any recorded tool call can be replayed to compare current behavior against the original execution.

## Data Storage

Argus uses SQLite for local storage. By default, the database is stored at `~/.argus/argus.db`.

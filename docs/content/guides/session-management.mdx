## Understanding Runs

Argus automatically groups tool calls into **runs**. A new run is created when:

- A proxy connection is established
- The idle timeout is exceeded (default: 60 seconds)

## Configuring Idle Timeout

Set a custom idle timeout with the `--idle-timeout` flag:

```bash
argus wrap --idle-timeout 120 -- your-mcp-server
```

Or in your config file:

```json
{
  "idleTimeout": 120
}
```

## Filtering by Run

In the dashboard, use the run selector to:
- View calls from a specific run
- Compare behavior across runs
- Focus on recent debugging sessions

## Run Statistics

Each run shows:
- Total number of calls
- Success/error breakdown
- Time span
- Servers involved

## Best Practices

- Use shorter timeouts for active debugging
- Use longer timeouts for monitoring
- Name your servers clearly for easy identification

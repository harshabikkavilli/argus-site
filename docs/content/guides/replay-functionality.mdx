## What is Replay?

Replay allows you to re-execute any recorded tool call **without involving the LLM**. This is useful for:

- Testing if a bug has been fixed
- Comparing behavior over time
- Debugging intermittent issues

## How to Replay

1. Open a tool call in the dashboard
2. Click the **Replay** button
3. View the side-by-side comparison

## Diff View

The replay feature shows a visual diff between:
- **Original**: The recorded response from the first execution
- **Replayed**: The new response from re-execution

Differences are highlighted to quickly spot changes.

## Use Cases

### Verifying Fixes

After fixing a bug in your MCP server, replay the failing call to confirm it now works.

### Testing Consistency

Replay calls to verify your tools return consistent results.

### Debugging State Issues

Compare results to identify if external state (database, files) affects behavior.
